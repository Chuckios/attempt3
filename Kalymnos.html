<h2>Guidebook</h2>
<p>The first thing you're going to do is <a href="https://climbkalymnos.com/guidebook/">buy the guidebook. </a>It is a beautiful piece of climbing art and you help support route development and 
maintainence on the island. It has all the info you need and is way more comprehensive than the information on mountainproject. </p>
<h2>Gear</h2>
<p>There were several routes where I lowered on an 80m rope and my belayer had to climb up to the first bolt for me to unweight and untie my knot.</p>

<h2>Travel</h2>
<h5>Getting to Athens</h5>
<p>Find a flight that arrives in Athens early afternoon. This gives you time to get from Athens to Kos, taxi to Mastichari port, ferry to Kalymnos, and then taxi to your housing.</p>

<h5>Athens to Kalymnos</h5>
<p>Once in Athens, we had a 90 minute layover. We got some food after 20 hours on an airplane, stretched out legs, and then headed to the terminal. We saw someone with a carabiner on their backpack and introduced ourselves. It turns out they were climbing in Kalymnos so we decided to travel together and split the taxi.
    We boarded an airplane to take us to Kos. Once in Kos, you take a taxi from the airport to the Port of Mastichari. This will take about 15 minutes and cost 15 euros (total, not per person). At the port, walk towards the ferry booth and purchase your ticket. It was 6 euro per person. Take a relaxing 45 minute ferry ride from Kos
    to Kalymnos. We saw the first of many beautiful sunsets on the sea. By the time we Got close Pothia, the port city of Kalymnos, it was dark and the town lit up. Our hosts from our accomodation picked us up at this point and it was a 15 minute drive to our housing. If you need to taxi, it'll be about 18 euros. 
</p>

<p>You can also fly directly from Athens to Kalymnos. The downside is the flights are limited to 1-2 times a week, expensive, and can be cancelled by weather because it's a small airplane. You can also take a 12 hour ferry from Athens to Kalymnos but that's another 12 hours of not climbing. Each way. </p>

<h2>Luggage</h2>
<p>We did carry on only for the entire trip so we didn't have to deal with checking luggage in. This reduced time to check in at the airport and eliminated the possibility of the airline losing our luggage. When you book your tickets, familiarize yourself with 
the size and weight restrictions. The whole thing is not straightforward, especially if you're using multiple airlines.</p>

<h2>Housing</h2>
<p>I recommend staying in Masouri. It's on the west coast of Kalymnos and you'll be within walking distance of dozens of crags, thousands routes, several mini-markets, a couple scooter/car rental agencies, and dozens of restaurants. There are plenty of studios and apartments to choose from. There's a reason why 
it's considered the "climber's village"! The sunsets on the Aegean after cragging are beautiful to witness while you eat gyros and fresh seafood. We stayed at <a href="https://aphroditestudios.info/">Aphrodite Studios.</a> The three week stay was good! There was a small kitchenette combined with a 
nearby mini market 100 feet away. We cooked our breakfasts and occasionally dinners in the studio. The beds were comfy and the hosts (Herre and Danielle) were really friendly and accomodating. The price was about $40 a night for 3 weeks in March. I would stay there again. We had about 1000 routes
within a 20 minute walk from the studio.</p>

<h2>Food</h2>
<p>Il Posto</p>
<p>This was a 20 minute walk from our studio. We ended up renting a car and that made it very accesible. The menu was 7 pages long so there's plenty of variety. The food was delicious, reasonably priced, and kept us coming back for more!
The staff was kind and friendly. When I reflect about my time in Kalymnos, I remember Il Posto fondly</p>

<p>Kouzina by the Sea</p>
<p>This was 2 minutes from our studio. They serve a mix of traditional Greek food and Asian style dishes. This was actually the first place we ate at because we arrived so late in the evening and it was still open and within a short walking distance.
Affordable and flavorful food. They were only open on the weekends during March but we went there several times. It's 15 feet from the ocean.</p>

<p>Miltos Taverna</p>
<p>This was on the way back from a lot of crags in Massouri and opened for the climbing season during the last week of our trip. We went here a couple times and the food was good. Traditional greek food, affordable, and a nice view of the ocean.
The staff was friendly and service was quick. We saw a lot of climbers here with their puffies and beanies.</p>

<p>AB Food Market</p>
<p>This is the equivalent of your local grocery store (Frys, Safeway, Trader Joes, etc). It's not within walking distance of Massouri so a car or scooter would be good. It's one of the biggest stores in 
    Kalymnos and has any food you want in there.
