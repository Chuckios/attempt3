<h1>Jack's Canyon</h1>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eqQLGnC.jpg" class="jackscanyon">

<p>I've never had a bad trip to Jack's Canyon. It's not a mind blowingly awesome crag but I know I'm going to have a good time with the fun routes, nice camping, and beautiful night sky. My favorite part of Jack's canyon is camping at night and seeing the galaxy full of stars. Camping is free and there's a vault toilet. The limestone is grippy, sometimes sharp with very little choss. Routes tend to be on the shorter side but that means you can get a lot of volume! There are several hundred routes from 5.5 to 5.14 so there's something for everyone. Most  the popular routes have lowering biners (don't TR through them) to speed up cleaning. The climbing is below the canyon rim so the approach is easy on the way down and a quick uphill walk on the way out. You have options for shade all day. The ground has a lot of fine dirt so bring a rope bag. Most of the routes at Jack's Canyon are soft so you can push the grade.</p>

<h3>Getting there</h3>
<p>The closest major towns are Winslow and Payson. Get any last minute food/supplies/firewood there. On highway 87, look for a gate on the west side of the road at milepost 313.7. Close the gate behind you! The last mile is a dirt road that is occasionally rocky. I have done it in my stock 2015 Toyota Camry with 5.7in of clearance dozens of time without issue. The left side of the road on the way in is usually better. Drive around the larger rocks and dips. Don't go after it's rained because mud. You don't need a crazy vehicle to access Jack's. Pro tip: load Google Maps in a town before you lose cell service. It takes you directly to the campground.</p>

<h3>Camping</h3>
<p>Camping is free! Bring your own water and firewood. Pack out all trash you bring. Don't poop in the canyon, it's a quick 10 minute hike to the vault toilet at the north side of the campsite. A few spots would work for a hammock both at the campsite and down at the crags. There are a few easily avoidable ant hills in the campsite so be aware. Bugs aren't bad and I haven't seen any animals there. Sometimes the cows get curious and will hang out with you.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>From the campsite, walk towards the canyon. If you don't see an obvious trail going down the canyon, turn right. It's 10 to 15 minutes to any wall. The first wall you see at the bottom of the canyon right in front of you is Casino Cliffs. Make a left and on the left side is Main Wall. Branch right further down the canyon and you'll see the Swiss Wall on the left and then Cracker Jack Cliffs on the right. Past Cracker Jack is the High Life Wall on the left.</p>

<h3>Sun/Shade</h3>
<p>Main wall gets AM shade and PM sun. Swiss wall goes into shade at 11am. All of Cracker is in the Sun by 10am. Casino Cliffs is shady by 1pm</p>

<h3>Routes you should climb!</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Gumby 5.5 great beginner lead</li>
	<li>Betty Cracker 5.9 positive crack climbing to jugs</li>

<figcaption>Here's what the parking area looks like.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The go to quick and easy winter desitination for Phoenix climbers. Located an hour east with a 10 minute approach, the Pond is very accesible crag with routes of a variety of grades. The climbing here is mostly pockets. A struggle on a lot of routes is there are 5 pockets within reach from any body postion but only 2 of them are good and you have to figure that out.

<h3>Getting there</h3>
<p>Drive east on the 60 through Superior then a big tunnel. Drive half a mile past the tunnel and park on the right. Look for a gravel pullout with a rock island in the middle. It looks like this:</p>
<h3>Camping</h3>
<p>Camping is available just up the road at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Oak+Flat+Campground/@33.3080642,-111.0518179,235m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x0:0x0!2zMzPCsDE4JzM3LjQiTiAxMTHCsDA0JzAzLjIiVw!3b1!8m2!3d33.3104!4d-111.06756!3m4!1s0x872981919ffb8ac3:0xaf39455b6a343625!8m2!3d33.3083297!4d-111.0511103?hl=en" target="_blank">Oak Flat Campground.</a></p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>Hike east on the right side of the road, turn left and go under the bridge. Go to the right side of the next area. There's a rebar ladder and slings to help ascend up to the climbing area. 

<h3>Sun/Shade</h3>
<p>Most of the Pond is sunny all day. The right side near the waterfall gets afternoon shade<p>

<h3>Routes you should climb!</h3>

<h1>Lime Kiln</h1>

<img src="">

<p>Bring your 70m and tie in with your belayer, you will be lowering tothe knot on some routes with the permanent lowering biners on all the routes.These lengthy high quality routes at Lime Kiln will make you smile as you getyourself lost in a sea of endless limestone. To top it off, the Grail is in theshade most of the day and some of the harder classics have perma-draws on them.</p>

<h3>Getting there</h3>
<p>The road is fine for a Toyota Camry. You do not need high clearance or 4x4. I’ve drivenup it in a ToyotaSiennaminivan as well. Use caution after rain.</p>

<h3>Camping</h3>
<p>There is dispersed camping along the road. The first site is on theleft about 500 feet from the parking area near a water trough. There areseveral spots near the parking area and a few more further up the road. You canalso stay at Virgin River Hotel and Casino. It’s $27 during the week days and$70 on the weekends.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>From the parking area, hike towards the wall following the only trail. It’sslightly uphill and gradually gets steeper. Once you reach the top of the hill,up and right goes to the Grail and down and left goes to the multipitch andback walls of Lime Kiln.</p>

<h3>Sun/Shade</h3>
<p>The multipitch routes are shady in the morning. Most of the Grail is inthe shade all day. Bring a jacket because it can get windy in the canyon!</p>

<h3>Routes you should climb!</h3>
<p>Single Pitch at the Grail</p>
<ul>
	<li>Eminent Domain 10a - good warm up with a thought inducing budge.</li>
	<li>I’m Not Dead Yet 10c 1st anchor – long, fun, big holds, cooltraverse at the end.</li>
	<li>Homeostasis 11b 30m 1st anchor – pumpy and physical 1sthalf, then crack, techy, and sidepulls 2nd half</li>
	<li>Khaleesi 11c 35m - slabby and technical, mentally demanding on smallfootholds/smears.</li>
	<li>The Serf 11d 33m 1st anchor, 12a 50m 2nd anchor – hard start into along journey, hard again right before 1st anchor.</li>
	<li>Mesquiter 12a 35m - permadraws after bolt 5, big pockets into a briefcrimpy crux, some fun filler climbing, then 2nd crux on weird slopey/crimpysidepulls. More crimping to the top. </li>
</ul>

<p>Multipitch at The Sacred Trust</p>
<p>Do these in the morning before they start baking in the sun.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Mystery Companion 10b 4 pitches. Link P1/P2 and P3/P4. P1 easy warmup,P2 short hard crux on small holds. P3 has a thoughtful traverse crux then a fundihedral. P4 continue up the dihedral. Stay left at the fork for 5.9 or goright for 10c. </li>
	<li>Office Party 10a 6 pitches Link P1/P2, P3/P4/P5, P6. I don’t remember a lot about this route but it was easy and good mileage.We did it 2 65m pitches and the rope drag was abhorrent even with long drawsand skipping bolts. Don’t do that. After P5, walk up and left to the base of P6,the 10a.</li>
	<li>Simple Truths 10c 5 pitches. Link P1/P2, P3/P4, P5. P1 has some coolholds on a slab. P2 is more slab and pockets. P3 trends left and is fun. P4 hasthe biggest layback flake into a pocketed face. Walk 30 feet right to the startof P5. It goes up a crack, traverses left, then straight up to the summit. Allthe pitches are engaging!</li>
</ul>

Keep going and eventually you’ll see the wall.Keep walking for a couple minutes and you’ll arrive at an obvious fork, turn leftand walk to the wall. This drops you off near Prosthesis.  </p>

	<li>New River 10b – slab start then jugs and overhang.</li>
	<li>Prosthesis 11 – easy climbing to a short roof, then tricky face/crackto the top. Optional .5 and 1 BD. The 1 is nice for when you’re pumped at thetop. The .5 for the bottom runout but it’s 5.7 terrain.</li>
