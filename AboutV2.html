    <p>I tried rock climbing for the first time in 2014 at a free event for college students. The next day, my face hurt from smiling because I had so much fun. Since then, I've dedicated my time and energy to improving my skills and teaching others how to transition from the gym to crag in a safe and 
		sustainable manner. As the Outdoor Rock Climbing Chair for the ASU Outdoors Club from 2016-2017, I organized 57 climbing trips with 650 attendees across the southwest United States.
	I emphasize on safety, sustainability, and independence on my trips. The adventure, fitness, and constant challenge keeps me coming back. I don't think I'll ever get good at climbing, I'll just suck a little less each year.</p>
    
    <p>I enjoy long days with lots of moderates, occasionally projecting something challenging, and quickly climbing multipitch sport routes. I used to climb trad but after a trip involving 
    hanging belays, an hour of boulder hopping, and bailing for Panda Express, I decided I don't like carrying heavy things and hiking for a long time.</p> 
    
    <p>My current goal is to climb 5.14a by 2025. Additionally, I am working towards early retirement to go travel and climb around Utah, Colorado, Europe, and Thailand. When I'm not rock climbing, 
	I like biking, swing dancing, short hikes, and eating dumplings from Costco.</p>
	
	
	
    <p>Favorite Crags: Lime Kiln Canyon, Sweet Pain Jack's Canyon, Prophesy Wall, Poets, and Arginonta Valley.</p>
